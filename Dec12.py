#Ponder This Challenge:
#36 people live in a 6x6 grid, and each one of them lives in a separate square of the grid. Each resident's neighbors are those who live in the squares that have a common edge with that resident's square.
#Each resident of the grid is assigned a natural number N, such that if a person receives some N>1, then he or she must also have neighbors that have been assigned all of the numbers 1,2,...,N-1.
#Find a configuration of the 36 neighbors where the sum of their numbers is at least 90.
#Finding a sum of more than 90 will earn you a star near your name.
#As an example, the highest sum we can get in a 3x3 grid is 20:
#1 2 1
#4 3 4
#2 1 2
